Priority List for Suggested Data

Since the first 5 fields are displayed for Suggested Data, we need to give
priority to the most important fields.  Whenever these fields have >1 value,
these should be displayed as keys with dropdowns for Suggested Data.

For example: If there is a record with multiple values for FirstName, Email,
Company, Title, and Website, then these would be the 5 fields/dropdowns
displayed on Suggested Data.  The rest of the fields would be revealed when
the user clicks "Show Details"
